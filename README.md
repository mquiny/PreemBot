## ✨ Features

### 📊 Revision Tracking & Changelogs
- Polls NexusMods every 15 minutes for collection updates and automatically updates Discord voice channels with the latest revision numbers and statuses
- Automatically generates detailed changelogs between revisions showing mod additions, removals, and version updates
- Supports multiple collection groups with templated changelog output (NCR, E33 templates)
- Converts changelog embeds to NexusMods-ready Markdown format for easy cross-posting
- Automatically schedules status reverts after updates

### 🔍 Crash Log Analysis
- Automated error pattern detection for uploaded `.log` or `.txt` files in the crash log channel
- Optional AI-powered summaries via OpenAI for deeper analysis
- Interactive "Scan a Log File" button and modal for users to submit logs directly
- Visual indicators: ❌ for errors detected, ✅ for clean logs

### 🛡️ Anti-Spam System
- Multi-rule spam detection engine with configurable rules:
  - Multi-channel spam detection
  - Duplicate content detection
  - Image spam detection
  - New account risk scoring
- Automatic timeout of detected spammers with message cleanup
- Mod alert embeds with action buttons (Confirm, False Positive, Ban, Adjust Timeout)
- Persistent user activity tracking across sessions
- Configurable whitelist for users and roles (moderators auto-whitelisted)
- Toggle and configure via `/antispam` command
- Debug test mode for alt-account simulation with trigger tokens:
  - `test:multi` or `multi channel spamming`
  - `test:carpet` or `carpet bombing`
  - `test:image` or `image spam`
  - ⚠️ Safety: disable debug mode after testing

### ⚖️ Moderation Tools
- **Warning System:** `/warn` to issue warnings with DM notifications, `/warnings` to view history, `/clearwarnings` to reset (persistent JSON storage)
- **Timeout:** `/timeout` with preset durations (1 min to 1 week) and reason tracking
- **Slowmode:** `/slowmode` to set channel rate limits (0–6 hours)
- **Support Mention Blocking:** `/blocksupportmention` and `/unblocksupportmention` to manage ping-banned users, with `/listsupportblocked` to list them
- **Autoresponder:** `/autoresponder` to create, edit, delete, and list trigger-based auto-responses (mod only, supports wildcard matching)

### 📋 Audit Logging
- Comprehensive event monitoring with rich colour-coded embeds matching Probot styling
- Tracks: bans, unbans, kicks, joins, leaves, timeouts, role/nickname changes, message edits/deletions, channel CRUD, thread CRUD
- Configurable per-event toggles via `/auditlog toggle`
- Set audit channel via `/auditlog channel`
- Anti-loop protection to prevent logging events in the audit channel itself
- Persistent configuration stored in `config/auditConfig.json`

### 📌 Forum Management (Bugs & Issues)
- Automatic "Investigating" tag application to new forum posts
- Bot alert notifications for new threads pinging support team
- Dynamic megathread management that auto-updates when thread tags change

### 🖼️ Media Channel Enforcement
- Designate channels as image-only via `/mediachannels`
- Automatically removes non-media messages in enforced channels

### 🤖 Bot Control Panel
- Interactive embed with Reload, Mute, Unmute, and Restart buttons
- Mute/unmute prevents bot from responding to events
- Restart triggers a full bot process restart (admin only)
- Persistent mute state across restarts

### 🔧 Status Channel Management

- Use `/antispam status` to review anti-spam configuration and detection stats
- Debug test flow:
  - `/antispam debug-set-user user:<alt account>`
  - `/antispam debug-enable`
  - Send test messages with `test:multi`, `test:carpet`, `test:image` (can be combined)
  - Confirm one evolving anti-spam alert message is edited, then run `/antispam debug-disable`
- Use `/refreshmegathread` to manually refresh forum megathread sections
- Use `/reload` (via bot control panel) to reload commands after updates
- To update environment variables, restart the bot process

## 🚀 Deployment

- **Deploy Slash Commands:**  
  Run `node deploy-commands.js` to register or update slash commands for your guild.
- **Automated Restarts:**  
  The provided GitHub Actions workflow triggers a server restart on push (see `.github/workflows/main.yml`).  
  Requires `PTERODACTYL_API_KEY` and `SERVER_ID` as GitHub secrets/variables.
- **Cybrancee Hosting:**  
  The bot is designed to run on Cybrancee with auto-update enabled, pulling from the `main` branch on restart.

---

## ❓ FAQ / Troubleshooting

**Q: My slash commands don't show up!**  
A: Make sure you ran `node deploy-commands.js` and that your bot has the `applications.commands` scope and correct permissions.

**Q: I get errors about missing environment variables.**  
A: Check `.env` and make sure all required values are present.

**Q: The bot doesn't update channels or reply to commands.**  
A: Verify your bot token, channel IDs, and that your bot user has permission to manage channels and post in the target channels.

**Q: How do I update dependencies?**  
A: Run `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities, then `npm audit fix` to patch what's safe. For breaking changes, use `npm audit fix --force` with caution.

**Q: Anti-spam is flagging legitimate users!**  
A: Use the "False Positive" button on the mod alert, or add the user to the whitelist via `/antispam whitelist`.

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **Never commit your real `.env` file or any secrets to version control!**
- Use `.env.example` as a template only.
- Only grant your bot the minimum Discord permissions required.
- Keep your dependencies up to date (`npm audit`).
- Make sure you do not log or echo API keys or secrets in public channels.
- Log rotation is configured (5MB per file, 3 rotated files max) to prevent disk filling.
